Here are the enhancements made to the code:

1. Added docstrings to all classes and methods to improve code readability and documentation.
2. Moved the import statements to the top and grouped them for better organization.
3. Added type hints to function arguments and return types.
4. Renamed the `BookRecommendationSystem` class to `BookRecommender` to provide a more concise name.
5. Extracted the URL for scraping into a constant variable to improve code maintainability.
6. Simplified the extraction of book information using the `select` method in BeautifulSoup.
7. Changed the `get_summary` method in the `Book` class to a property decorator for improved access.
8. Simplified the code in the `get_book_recommendations` method by using list comprehension and slicing.
9. Added error handling in case the user input has no matching books.
10. Added type hints and improved variable names in the `preprocess_input` and `_calculate_similarity` methods.
11. Changed the `print_recommendations` method to use f-strings for improved readability.
12. Added a main function to encapsulate the creation of the `BookRecommender` instance and running the recommendation system.
