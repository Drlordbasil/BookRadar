# Personalized Book Recommendation System

This Python project aims to create a personalized book recommendation system based on users' reading preferences and interests. By gathering data from various online sources and analyzing it, the program generates tailored book recommendations that match the user's input.

## Features

1. **User Input:** Users can input their favorite genres, authors, or specific books they have enjoyed.
2. **Web Scraping:** The program utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` library to scrape book information, including titles, authors, genres, ratings, reviews, and summaries, from popular book websites or user-contributed lists.
3. **Data Analysis:** Machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity are applied to analyze the scraped book data and identify patterns and similarities among different books.
4. **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on the user's input and preferences, the program generates personalized book recommendations using the analyzed data.
5. **Search and Filter:** Users can search for books within specific genres, by author, or by combining multiple filters to find their desired book recommendations.
6. **User Interface:** The program provides a user-friendly interface where users can view the recommended books, read book summaries, and access external links to purchase or learn more about the recommended books.
